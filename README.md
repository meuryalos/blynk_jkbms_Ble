## Features
*   **Real-time Monitoring**:
    
    *   All data that are also available via the app
        
    *   Cell voltages, resistances, temperatures, battery voltage, current, state of charge and more
        
    *   BMS settings and status flags.
        


Installation
------------

*   **Get startet**:

    *   copy jk-bms.ino local
    
*   **Open the Project in Arduino IDE**:
    
    *   Open the¬†jk-bms.ino¬†file in the Arduino IDE.
        
*   **Install Required Libraries**:
    
    *   Install the libraries NimBLEDevice + ArduinoJson
 
    *   All others are included in the IDE by default
 
*   **Edit settings**:

    *   WiFi SSID / Password / AUTH + bluetooth MAC from the BMS
        
*   **Upload the Sketch**:
    
    *   Connect your ESP32 to your computer.
        
    *   Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
        
    *   Upload the sketch to the ESP32.
        
*   **Access the Web Interface**:
    
    *   After the upload, the ESP32 will connect to your Wi-Fi and the IP will be displayed in the serial monitor.
        
    *   Open a web browser and navigate to the IP address of the ESP32.
 
    *   A small error message appears that no Index.html was found
 
    *   Follow the link or use http://IP/fs to upload index.html + style.css to the ESP32
 
## Examples

   *   Serial interface
